## Layered Architecture
Bindle allows for creating forms and fields via ```Bindle``` component for a batteries included version.

For more advanced use cases you can create custom components using the [core](404) package

## Modular
Issues with node based systems, they carry tons of bloat meaning you have a massive object with lots of information which isn't easy to understand where anything is, this also makes it hard to break the node down to be modular in the future.

## Approach
Every composable to construct a field or form should have self contained state with useful composable to manipulate the state.

## Schemas
Schemas will need to be in a JSON format allowing for easy to change forms with minimal additions so non technical people can use them.
```ts
{
  $bindle: 'text',
  name: 'textInput',
  Label: 'Example text input',
  value: 'Prepopulated'
}
```

I will need to narrow the type for my parser so I can then generate the correct stuff to bind
