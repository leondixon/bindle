## Layered Architecture
Bindle allows for creating forms and fields via ```Bindle``` component for a batteries included version.

For more advanced use cases you can create custom components using the [core](404) package

## Modular
Issues with node based systems, they carry tons of bloat meaning you have a massive object with lots of information which isn't easy to understand where anything is, this also makes it hard to break the node down to be modular in the future.

### Approach
Every composable to construct a field or form should have self contained state with useful composable to manipulate the state.
